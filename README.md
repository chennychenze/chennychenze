# ðŸ’« Hi there
My name is Chenze Chen and I am currently pursuing BS in Computer Science and Applied Data Analytics at Syracuse University.<br>
I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks like JavaScript and React, and I have a passion for full stack web development.<br>
In my free time, I like to play League and watch animes for fun :)
